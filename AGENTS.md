This is the source code of BLAST from NCBI.

We need to work on src/app/blastdb/legacy_header_reader.cpp This file was written by you not by NCBI.
It reads .phr files from BLAST databases decoding header information.
The file needs to remain without dependencies and be self contained. Reimplement the code that is needed.
